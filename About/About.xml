Retexture for wood floor (dark and light version), stone tiles, concrete, paved, metal and sterile tiles.

This means that they will replace the current vanilla textures.

Metal and sterile tiles were separated since they were using the same texture file in vanilla.

If you want just the wood floor texture:

If you want just the stone tile texture:

If you want concrete, paved, metal or sterile as a individual mod like the two above, let me know.

If you are already using the two individual mods for stone and wood, you probably need to remove then if you goind to use this one. Stone is just a texture so it might not give a problem, but for the wood floor I had to duplicate it to make the light version so it might pop an error when you start the game.

---

Added new texture for gold and silver metal tile, the vanilla texture was for metal, gold and silver, so now each has their own texture. Also change the color a bit.

---

Added royalty nice floor and a special nice floor as well, check out the screenshots. I kind of liked the original nice floor so I didn't tweak too much on it but added the special version that changes it quite a bit.
